# Overview

This is the classic Hello World Progeam, I wrote it to demonstrate my development enviroment using Python, C++, and C#. 
As a software developer, I am trying to learn and master the computer languages, so I could develop some great softwares to help people and make their life easier.

In this repository, you will see three different computer languages(python, C++, and C#) to output the message "Hello World!"

I am hoping in this repository, you will see how amazing the computer languages are, and how much creativity it has! 

The link below is a video which I demostrated how to use those three languages to send the "Hello World!" messgae.
